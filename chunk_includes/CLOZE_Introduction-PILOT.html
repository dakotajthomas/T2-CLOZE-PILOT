Below is an example of how to load an image without showing it.

<h1>DIRECTIONS: Cloze Task</h1>
<p>
    Speakers of a language seem to develop a <i>feel</i> for what is a possible sentence, even in many cases where they have never been taught any particular rules.  Additionally, speakers are able to complete sentences when certain elements or words of a sentence are missing.  For example, in English, consider the sentences below and how the blanks in the sentences might be filled in.
</p>
<p>
<u>Sentences</u>
<br><b>a)</b>   <i>She _____ going to win the race.</i>
<br><b>b)</b>   <i>Joseph finally got an "A+" on _____ of his papers.</i>
<br><b>c)</b>   <i>Two kids _____ playing in the park yesterday.</i>
<br><b>d)</b>   <i>DO you know _____ she put the pencils?</i>
</p>
<p>
<u>Answers</u>
<br><b>a)</b>   <i>She <b>is</b> going to win the race.</i>
<br><b>b)</b>   <i>Joseph finally got an "A+" on <b>one</b> of his papers.</i>
<br><b>c)</b>   <i>Two kids <b>were</b> playing in the park yesterday.</i>
<br><b>d)</b>   <i>Do you know <b>where</b> she put the pencils?</i>
</p>
<p>
In this experiment, you will read sentences that have two blanks in them. You need to read each sentence and choose the best word or words to complete each sentence from the drop-down lists. Read each sentence carefully before you answer. Think of the sentences as spoken English and judge them accordingly. Work as quickly and accurately as you can.
</p>
<p>
Each sentence will appear similar to this: 
<br>
I was <select name="blank", class = "obligatory">, <option value="none"> </option>, <option value="late">late</option>, <option value="lating">lating</option>, </select> to the party.  
</p>
<p>
After each sentence click "â†’ Click here to continue".
</p>
<p>
The following three sentences are practice items.  After the practice items, the experiment will begin.
